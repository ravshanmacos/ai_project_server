### 28. With all the troubles in the world today, money spent on space exploration is a complete waste. The money could be better spent on other things. Nations after nations, everyday, every year, celebrate their achievements in space exploration . However, it is now time to question how meaningful these blasts are. This essay aims to explain why it is questionable. First, until all urgent and important matters in this globe have been solved, money bumped on space exploration is of no meaning. It is not a common sense at all to invest million dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while everyday thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority are even not welleducated. Those in rural areas or third-world nations do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases like AIDS and lung cancer. Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration are to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to globe. Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? Lands on earth are no yet effectively used. New energy resources (e. g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All these ? not- yets? need money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of money. In the nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration providing that () earlymentioned urgent and important matters have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaign should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before money is wasted. This is a  good essay, well done.
